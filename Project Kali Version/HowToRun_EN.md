pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Icon.ico --name evilcyberbunckertool main.py
```

***Command Line Explanation:***
- `pyinstaller:` This tool compiles Python applications into standalone executables.
- `--onefile:` Creates a single executable file from all code files.
- `--icon:` Sets a custom icon for the application, specified by an .ico file.
- `--name:` Names the compiled application. In this example, it's named evilcyberbunckertool.
- `main.py:` This is the main script containing the entry point of the application. Modifying this file name in the command may result in build errors.
