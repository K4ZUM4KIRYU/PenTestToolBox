# ‚ùì For WHO ? </br>
"Unlock the potential of security testing with a toolbox crafted for penetration testers by penetration testers."

# ü´Ä EvilCyberBunckerToolBox
A comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed for conducting penetration testing and security assessments. Each module is crafted to perform specific tasks such as network scanning, directory enumeration, vulnerability assessments, and various brute force attacks.

# ü´µ Overview
The Penetration Testing Toolbox is a sophisticated and robust toolkit crafted to assist cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts in conducting ethical hacking and penetration testing. Developed with the latest cybersecurity libraries in Python, this toolbox is freely available under an open-source license, encouraging community collaboration and improvement.

The primary goal of this toolbox is to automate and enhance the security testing process, ensuring high performance and accuracy in the detection of vulnerabilities across systems and networks. Moreover, the toolbox not only performs fast scanning tasks but also organizes and presents the results in detailed text formats to aid in easy comprehension and reporting.

## üìú Modules Documentation
Here you can find more details about each module of the code with an example usage if you wish to test the codes one by one, but in this case a main function in each code must be added, else the test will not work. </br>

I would recommend running the main.py for testing the code via for example VScode, or by creating a .exe file which can be found below in the "APPLICATION USAGE" section "STEP3".

## 5. Docker Instructions
Build the Docker image and run it using the following commands:
```docker build -t yourimagename .
docker run -it yourimagename
```

If the Docker image is hosted on a registry:
```docker pull yourusername/yourimagename:latest
docker run -it yourusername/yourimagename:latest
```

The command to pull a Docker image on your machine from a Docker registry involves specifying the image's name and optionally the tag (version) you want to pull. If you've pushed your Docker image to Docker Hub or another Docker registry, you would typically use the following command format:

```
docker pull [username]/[imagename]:[tag]
```
Here‚Äôs how you can use it, assuming:

Your Docker Hub username is k4zum4kiryu98. </br>
Your Docker image is named evilcyberbunckertool. </br>
You are using the latest or v1.0 tag for the most recent version of the image. 

```
docker pull k4zum4kiryu98/evilcyberbunckertool:v1.0
```
