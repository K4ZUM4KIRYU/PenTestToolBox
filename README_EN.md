# For WHO ? </br>
"Unlock the potential of security testing with a toolbox crafted for penetration testers by penetration testers."

# EvilCyberBunckerToolBox
A comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed for conducting penetration testing and security assessments. Each module is crafted to perform specific tasks such as network scanning, directory enumeration, vulnerability assessments, and various brute force attacks.

# Overview
The Penetration Testing Toolbox is a sophisticated and robust toolkit crafted to assist cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts in conducting ethical hacking and penetration testing. Developed with the latest cybersecurity libraries in Python, this toolbox is freely available under an open-source license, encouraging community collaboration and improvement.

The primary goal of this toolbox is to automate and enhance the security testing process, ensuring high performance and accuracy in the detection of vulnerabilities across systems and networks. Moreover, the toolbox not only performs fast scanning tasks but also organizes and presents the results in detailed text formats to aid in easy comprehension and reporting.

## ‚öô Installation 
## Prerequisites
Before installing the toolbox, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Docker, Linux, Windows)
- Python version 3.6 or higher

## Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up the Penetration Testing Toolbox on your machine:

## 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/K4ZUM4KIRYU/PenTestToolBox.git
```

## 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd your-penetration-testing-toolbox-directory
```

## 3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìú Modules
The toolbox is structured into several key modules:

- **footprinting.py:** Gathers preliminary data about the target to tailor further tests.
- **nmap_scan.py:** Leverages Nmap to conduct thorough network scans.
- **nmap_cve.py:** Utilizes Nmap scripts to check for vulnerabilities linked to known CVEs.
- **enumerating_system.py:** Extracts detailed system configurations and active services.
- **dir_subdir_enum.py & web_app_dir_subdir_enum.py:** Performs exhaustive directory scanning on web servers.
- **ftp_bruteforce.py & ssh_bruteforce.py:** Implements aggressive password cracking techniques.
- **main.py:** Integrates all modules for a unified testing workflow.

## üìñ Usage
***Step 1: Clone the Repository***
To clone the repository, execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/K4ZUM4KIRYU/PenTestToolBox.git

***Step 3: Build the Application***
Open CMD or PowerShell on a Windows system, or Terminal on a Linux system. Use the following command to build the application:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Icon.ico --name evilcyberbunckertool main.py
```

***Command Line Explanation:***
- `pyinstaller:` This tool compiles Python applications into standalone executables.
- `--onefile:` Creates a single executable file from all code files.
- `--icon:` Sets a custom icon for the application, specified by an .ico file.
- `--name:` Names the compiled application. In this example, it's named evilcyberbunckertool.
- `main.py:` This is the main script containing the entry point of the application. Modifying this file name in the command may result in build errors.

***Example on how to run:***
- ***ls*** command to list files and directories
