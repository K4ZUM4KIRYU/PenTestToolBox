# For WHO ? </br>
"Unlock the potential of security testing with a toolbox crafted for penetration testers by penetration testers."

# EvilCyberBunckerToolBox
A comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed for conducting penetration testing and security assessments. Each module is crafted to perform specific tasks such as network scanning, directory enumeration, vulnerability assessments, and various brute force attacks.

# Overview
The Penetration Testing Toolbox is a sophisticated and robust toolkit crafted to assist cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts in conducting ethical hacking and penetration testing. Developed with the latest cybersecurity libraries in Python, this toolbox is freely available under an open-source license, encouraging community collaboration and improvement.

The primary goal of this toolbox is to automate and enhance the security testing process, ensuring high performance and accuracy in the detection of vulnerabilities across systems and networks. Moreover, the toolbox not only performs fast scanning tasks but also organizes and presents the results in detailed text formats to aid in easy comprehension and reporting.

## üîê Key Functions
- **Comprehensive Scanning** - From footprinting to detailed network sweeps.
- **Vulnerability Analysis** - Automated scripts to identify known vulnerabilities.
- **Brute Force Attacks** - Tools to test the resilience of FTP and SSH services against brute force.
- **Modular Design** - Use standalone scripts or integrate them into larger test frameworks.
- **Easy to Use** - Simple command-line interface, suitable for automation and manual use.

## ‚öô Installation 
## Prerequisites
Before installing the toolbox, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Docker, Linux, Windows)
- Python version 3.6 or higher

## Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up the Penetration Testing Toolbox on your machine:

## 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/K4ZUM4KIRYU/PenTestToolBox.git
```

## 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd your-penetration-testing-toolbox-directory
```

## 3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìú Modules
The toolbox is structured into several key modules:

- **footprinting.py:** Gathers preliminary data about the target to tailor further tests.
- **nmap_scan.py:** Leverages Nmap to conduct thorough network scans.
- **nmap_cve.py:** Utilizes Nmap scripts to check for vulnerabilities linked to known CVEs.
- **enumerating_system.py:** Extracts detailed system configurations and active services.
- **dir_subdir_enum.py & web_app_dir_subdir_enum.py:** Performs exhaustive directory scanning on web servers.
- **ftp_bruteforce.py & ssh_bruteforce.py:** Implements aggressive password cracking techniques.
- **main.py:** Integrates all modules for a unified testing workflow.

## üìú Modules Documentation
Here you can find more details about each module of the code with an example usage if you wish to test the codes one by one, but in this case a main function in each code must be added, else the test will not work. </br>

I would recommend running the main.py for testing the code via for example VScode, or by creating a .exe file which can be found below in the "APPLICATION USAGE" section "STEP3".

1. ***Footprinting*** (`footprinting.py`) </br>

**Function:** </br>
This module is designed to gather preliminary information about a target system or network, which includes publicly accessible data that can be useful in further penetration tests.

**Parameters:** </br>
- `--target`: Specify the target domain or IP address.

**Expected Output:** </br> 
A report containing various pieces of information about the target, such as domain registration details, associated IP addresses, and publicly visible directory listings.

**Example Usage:** </br>
For individual testing of each code, please add the main loop at the end of each `module.py` code. </br>

`python3 footprinting.py --target example.com or target IP address`

Otherwise, you can execute them by only running the main.py which includes all the functions and modules combined into a single executable python code.

2. ***Nmap Scan*** (`nmap_scan.py`) </br>

**Function:** </br>
Utilizes Nmap to perform comprehensive scans on the network, identifying active devices, open ports, and services running on hosts.

**Parameters:** </br>
- `--target`: Target network or IP range.
- `--ports`: (Optional) Port range to scan.

**Expected Output:** </br> 
A detailed summary of the scan results, including host statuses, open ports, and detected services.

**Example Usage:** </br>
For individual testing of each code, please add the main loop at the end of each `module.py` code. </br>

`python3 nmap_scan.py --target 192.168.1.1/24 --ports 1-65535
`



## üìñ Application Usage
***Step 1: Clone the Repository***
To clone the repository, execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/K4ZUM4KIRYU/PenTestToolBox.git
```

***Step 3: Build the Application***
Open CMD or PowerShell on a Windows system, or Terminal on a Linux system. Use the following command to build the application:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Icon.ico --name evilcyberbunckertool main.py
```

***Command Line Explanation:***
- `pyinstaller:` This tool compiles Python applications into standalone executables.
- `--onefile:` Creates a single executable file from all code files.
- `--icon:` Sets a custom icon for the application, specified by an .ico file.
- `--name:` Names the compiled application. In this example, it's named evilcyberbunckertool.
- `main.py:` This is the main script containing the entry point of the application. Modifying this file name in the command may result in build errors.

***Example on how to run:***
- ***ls*** command to list files and directories
